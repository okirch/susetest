.SH NAME
twopence tabulate-results \- helper application for tabulating results of test suite/matrix runs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B twopence tabulate-results
.SH DESCRIPTION
Each set of tests run by
.BR twopence-run-test "(1) or
.BR twopence-run-suite (1)
produces a summary document named
.BR results.xml
in the logspace directory.  This file can be read and processed by other tools, such as
.BR twopece-tabulate-results (1).
.P
This command tabulates the results of such a run, in human readable form.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI --logspace " directory
Specify the logspace of a previous test run.
.TP
.BI --testrun " name
Specify the name of the previous test run.
.TP
.BI --document-root " PATH"
Write any generated output to files below \fIPATH\fP, rather than standard output.
.TP
.BI --format " FORMAT
Generate report in a different format. The default format is \fBtext\fP, which just writes
some human readable output.
.IP
The \fBhtml\fP format renders the test results to as a table. Without \fB--output-directory\fP,
this will just write the HTML document to standard output. With \fB--output-directory\fP, the
document is written to \fBindex.html\fP in the output directory.
.IP
If \fBtabulate-results\fP is invoked with \fB--output-directory\fP it will also
render the contents of each test case's test report as HTML and write it to a separate file.
