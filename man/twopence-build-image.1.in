.TH TWOPENCE-BUILD-IMAGE "1" "@DATE@" "@SUSETEST_VERSION@" "build silver image for twopence"
.SH NAME
twopence build-image \- helper application for building derived images
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "twopence list-platforms --base-platform " PLATFORM " [ --feature " FEATURE "... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This utility builds a derived platforms for twopence based testing.
.P
A platform consists of a configuration file that describes the platform in some
detail - where to get image(s) from, the actual OS image, SSH keys, which repositories
have been activated, etc.
.P
.B twopence-build-image
works by provisioning a node with the specified base platform,
optionally applying the requested build features, such as
.BR selinux " or " fips .
When done, the node is taken down again, and the result is saved as a new platform below
the user's
.B ~/.twopence
directory.
.P
The name of the new platform is constructed from the name of the base platform, plus
the list of features enabled. For example, when invoked like this:
.PP
.B "  twopence build-image --base-platform leap-15.3 --feature selinux
.PP
the resulting platform is stored as
.BR leap-15.3-selinux .
For builds without any features, the resulting platform is called
.BI "" base-platform -silver
in order to distinguish it from the actual base platform.
