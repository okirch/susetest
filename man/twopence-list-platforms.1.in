can be used directly for provisioning a node. Right now,
.BR twopence-provision (1)
only supports vagrant based provisioning, hence these base platforms are
configured to use a vagrant image provided by on vagrantcloud.

A derived build is a platform image built from one of the available
base image, with additional configuration. Currently, the base images
for CentOS and SLES provide build options that can be used to create
a derived image with SELinux and/or FIPS 140-2 mode enabled.
