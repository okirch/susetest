# How to use susetest with Suseforma


### Suseforma (salt+ terraform)

Suseforma, provide you a fast way to spawn machines (terraform) and provisioning them (salt).

Once your machines are up and ready (config-files, services configured, etc with salt), you can use susetest in a control-node machine,
or in your localhost, to run multiple machines test.


So in this way, you can do the real test with susetest, and the pre-conf test part with suseforma.

Take a look here, https://github.com/MalloZup/suseforma, to see how simple is suseforma.
