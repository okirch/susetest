Critical bugs:
	FIXME: Leap-15.4 with fips seems to be broken (never comes back from reboot)

twopence:
	FEATURE: server needs journal support
	FEATURE: server should set /proc/self/loginuid between fork and exec
	FIXME: NUL termination problem somewhere in the audit message passing
		(permissive=0rminal=?)

	Sometimes, we receive a spurious core dump on exit. Could be related
	to libcurlies...

provisioning:
	FEATURE: rewrite the provisioning from doing it with scripts to
		doing it through twopence. The only bit that needs to be
		done in vagrant is import the RPM key, activate the twopence
		repo and install the test server

	FEATURE: support for rmt/smt proxy
	FEATURE: logging to file
	FIXME: test compatibility handling is broken & currently disabled
	FIXME: topology teardown should only consult status.conf
	FEATURE: offer a "brutal" mode to topology teardown that works
		even if the vagrant directory is gone
	FEATURE: distinguish between provisioner and image library
		(we already do this for container, but we should do this
		for virt images as well)
	FEATURE: implement pure libvirt provisioner than can consume
		vagrant images, too

susetest:
	FEATURE: Separate the user creation in UserResource and move
		it into a UserManager class

	FEATURE: attach to SUT's journal event source
	FEATURE: run-test should support --role-parameter

Results processing:
	FEATURE: comparison of two test runs (regression analysis)

html rendering:
	FEATURE: more grouping of activities (such as file editing).
		Display these as HTML collapsibles

SELinux:
	FEATURE: SELinux resources should specify domains and who
	is allowed to transition to them (simple)


Farthings:
	FIXME: change ntp to use file editing provided by resource mechanism
	FEATURE: reimplement ntp as applications
	FEATURE: mariadb test case
	FEATURE: mount test case
	FEATURE: nfs-server test case
