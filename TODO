twopence:
	FEATURE: server needs journal support
	FEATURE: server should set /proc/self/loginuid between fork and exec
	FIXME: NUL termination problem somewhere in the audit message passing
		(permissive=0rminal=?)

provisioning:
	FEATURE: rewrite the provisioning from doing it with scripts to

		repo and install the test server

	FIXME: test compatibility handling is broken & currently disabled
	FIXME: topology teardown should only consult status.conf
	FEATURE: offer a "brutal" mode to topology teardown that works
		even if the vagrant directory is gone

susetest:
	FIXME: Rewrite resource handling to make it saner
		start by dropping resource manager plugging
		and the groupBegin callback

	FEATURE: Separate the user creating in UserResource and move
		it into a UserManager class

	FIXME: unexpected audit messages should raise a warning
	FEATURE: attach to SUT's journal event source
